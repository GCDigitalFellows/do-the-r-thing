## By way of introduction

> - My name is Tahir and I am
> - a doctoral candidate in Urban Education,
> - learned my first programming language (Pascal) in the summer of 1996,
> - studied computational linguistics in college,
> - began programming Python in 2005 at my first real job,
> - began using R in 2009,
> - moved to Python (and Pandas) for data analysis because I hated R,
> - but experimented with R again after many years this past December,
> - and now I have seen the error of my ways.

## How I have used R

1. EOP
2. Visualizing NEH
3. Scraping

## Why you use R | Or should, if you are not already

1. Because it is open source and free, unlike Stata, SAS, SPSS, ...
2. Very good online help through forums like StackOverflow
3. Pretty graphics with `ggplot2`
