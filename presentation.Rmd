Is there a *right* way of doing data analysis in R? Why does it even matter?

## By way of introduction

> - My name is Tahir and I am
> - a doctoral candidate in Urban Education,
> - learned my first programming language (Pascal) in the summer of 1996,
> - studied computational linguistics in college,
> - began programming Python in 2005 at my first real job,
> - began using R in 2009,
> - moved to Python (and Pandas) for data analysis because I hated R,
> - but experimented with R again after many years this past December,
> - and now I have seen the error of my ways.

## Data analysis, brought to you by the letter R

![](images/rlogo.png)

<div class="notes">
1. Q: How many have done data analysis?
2. Q: How many have already some experience with R?
3. I am assuming you at have done data analysis before, not necessarily with R, nor necessarily with prior programming experience.

## By way of introduction (cont.)

### Analysis of data?

"Procedures for **analyzing** data, techniques for **interpreting** the results of such procedures, ways of planning the **gathering** of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) **statistics** which apply to analyzing data." (John W. Tukey, 1961) 

### What is R?

R is a **language and environment** for statistical computing and graphics

## New Zealand is for loveRs

### Where did it come from?

R was created by two **New Zealand** academics named Ross and Robert and released in 1995

### Is R only for Kiwis?

Though it seems to help (e.g., **Hadley Wickham**, more on him later), the benefits of R are universal, transcultural, and, possibly, transhistorical.

This workshop covers **all but the Model stage** but we will definitely **explore data**.

## Why you use R | Or should, if you are not already

* Because it is **open source and free**, unlike Stata, SAS, SPSS, etc.
* Very good **documentation** and lots of help through [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
* Pretty graphics with the `ggplot2` package
* `install.packages()` many other packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/))

## But most importantly 

* Fascism lost so you don't have to settle for Excel

## How not to teach R

Garrett Grolemund of RStudio has [enumerated](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/02/22/how-to-teach-r-common-mistakes/) principles we will follow:

1. Do not teach R as if it were a programming language: empower students to use R for data science
2. Do not avoid the lecture: convey large amounts of information in a short period of time
3. Do not let your workshop become a consulting clinic for installation bugs:  provide a classroom RStudio Server for students to use

* Come to Digital Fellows office hours for help installing R and RStudio

# Getting started

## RStudio

* Turn on your computers
* Open your web browser to web address provided
* Login with user and password provided

## Create an R project

![](images/rstudio-newproject.png)

* New Project > New Directory > Empty Project
* Enter "[LAST]-[FIRST]" in Directory Name
* Create Project


## The R Console

```{r echo=TRUE,results='hide'}
sessionInfo()
```

```
R version 3.4.0 (2017-04-21)
Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit)
Running under: Debian GNU/Linux 8 (jessie)

Matrix products: default
BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/libopenblasp-r0.2.12.so

locale:
 [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NUMERIC=C               LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8       
 [4] LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8     LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8    LC_MESSAGES=C             
 [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8       LC_NAME=C                  LC_ADDRESS=C

## Keeping an R Notebook

An R **Notebook** is an R **Markdown** document with chunks that can be executed **independently** and **interactively**, with output visible immediately beneath the input ([rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html))

### Creating a Notebook

File > New File > R Notebook

```
---
title: "My Notebook"
output: html_notebook
---
```

## Reproducible research

R Notebooks are a method of **literate programming** that allows for direct interaction with R while producing **a reproducible document** with publication-quality output ([rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html))

This presentation is actually written in R Markdown, so the output of a block of code can be included in the resulting document:

```{r fig.width=4,fig.height=1.5}
library(ggplot2)
data(iris)
ggplot(data=iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width)) + geom_point()
```

## How I have used R

1. EOP
2. Visualizing NEH
3. Scraping
