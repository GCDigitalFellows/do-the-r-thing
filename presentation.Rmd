> - Is there a *right* way of doing data analysis in R? Why does it even matter?
</div>

## By way of introduction

> - My name is Tahir and I am
> - a doctoral candidate in Urban Education,
> - learned my first programming language (Pascal) in the summer of 1996,
> - studied computational linguistics in college,
> - began programming Python in 2005 at my first real job,
> - began using R in 2009,
> - moved to Python (and Pandas) for data analysis because I hated R,
> - but experimented with R again after many years this past December,
> - and now I have seen the error of my ways.

## Data analysis, brought to you by the letter R

![](images/rlogo.png)

<div class="notes">
> - Q: How many have done data analysis?
> - Q: How many have already some experience with R?
> - I am assuming you at have done data analysis before, not necessarily with R, nor necessarily with prior programming experience.
</div>

## By way of introduction (cont.)

### Analysis of data?

"Procedures for **analyzing** data, techniques for **interpreting** the results of such procedures, ways of planning the **gathering** of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) **statistics** which apply to analyzing data." (John W. Tukey, 1961) 

### What is R?

R is a **language and environment** for statistical computing and graphics

## New Zealand is for loveRs

### Where did it come from?

R was created by two **New Zealand** academics named Ross and Robert and released in 1995

### Is R only for Kiwis?

Though it seems to help (e.g., **Hadley Wickham**, more on him later), the benefits of R are universal, transcultural, and, possibly, transhistorical.

![r4ds.had.co.nz](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/data-science-explore.png)
 
This workshop covers **all but the Model stage** but we will definitely **explore data**.

## Why you use R | Or should, if you are not already

* Because it is **open source and free**, unlike Stata, SAS, SPSS, etc.
* Very good **documentation** and lots of help through [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)
* Pretty graphics with the `ggplot2` package
* `install.packages()` many other packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/))

## But most importantly 

* Fascism lost so you don't have to settle for Excel

## How not to teach R

Garrett Grolemund of RStudio has [enumerated](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/02/22/how-to-teach-r-common-mistakes/) principles we will follow:

1. Do not teach R as if it were a programming language: empower students to use R for data science
2. Do not avoid the lecture: convey large amounts of information in a short period of time
3. Do not let your workshop become a consulting clinic for installation bugs:  provide a classroom RStudio Server for students to use

<div class="notes">
* Come to Digital Fellows office hours for help installing R and RStudio

## Start a new R Notebook

An R **Notebook** is an R **Markdown** document with chunks that can be executed **independently** and **interactively**, with output visible immediately beneath the input ([rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html))

File > New File > R Notebook

## Reproducible research

R Notebooks are a method of **literate programming** that allows for direct interaction with R while producing **a reproducible document** with publication-quality output ([rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html))

This presentation is actually written in R Markdown, so the output of a block of code can be included in the resulting document:

```{r fig.width=4,fig.height=1.5}
library(ggplot2)
data(iris)
ggplot(data=iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width)) + geom_point()
```

# Basics for data analysis

## Welcome to the tidyverse

```{r echo=TRUE,message=FALSE,results='hide',warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

![](images/tidyverse-packages.png)

<div class="notes">
> - These projects together share a common philosophy that marks an important shift away from the old, and arguably more frustrating, way of doing data analysis in R
</div>

## The tidy data way

![](images/tidyrules.png)

<div class="notes">
r4ds suggests three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

> - Each variable must have its own column.
> - Each observation must have its own row.
> - Each value must have its own cell.
</div>

## Importing data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
readr::read_csv('https://data.ny.gov/api/views/28gk-bu58/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD')
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
download.file('http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/data/college/mrc_table1.xlsx', 
              destfile = 'mrc_table1.xlsx',
              method='curl')
readxl::read_excel('mrc_table1.xlsx')
```

<div class="notes">
> - We use the `readr::read_csv()` for CSV files and `readxl::read_excel()` for Excel files
> - Notice `read_csv` can take a url whereas we need to download the excel file first
</div>

## First, some data

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
flights[1:5,]
```

<div class="notes">
> - We are going to load flight data and inspect the first five rows
</div>

## Pipe it like it's hot


<div class="columns-2">
![](images/pipeitlikeitshot.png)

> - a pipe is expressed by `%>%` from the `magittr` package
> - clearly expresses a sequence of operations
> - even more powerful when used as part of `tidyverse`

</div>

## Selecting and transforming data

```{r}
flights %>%
  mutate(date = sprintf('%d-%.2d-%.2d', year, month, day)) %>%
  select(date, air_time, distance) %>%
  separate(date, "-", into=c("year", "month", "day"), remove=FALSE) %>%
  head(5)
```

<div class="notes">
> - `mutate()` creates new variables
> - `select()` selects variables
> - `separate()` turns a single chr variable into multiple (opposite `unite` can replace `mutate`)
> - We never change the state of the program, `flights` is not mutated even though we call `mutate`
> - `remove=FALSE` there so we can see what we created in the previous step
> - `mutate` and `select` from `dplyr` whereas `separate` from `tidyr`
</div>


## Filtering and ordering data

```{r}
flights %>%
  filter(day < 8) %>%
  arrange(-air_time,distance) %>%
  select(carrier, flight, air_time, distance) %>%
  head(5)
```

<div class="notes">
> - `filter()` reduces the number of observations using a matching condition
> - `arrange()` order data by the value of particular variables
> - `day` variable is of time `<int>` so we can be sure this matching condition
> - The use of the negative sign (`-`) in the `arrange` function before a variable specifies that we want to order the data in descending order for that variable. Here we have combined both ascending and descending ordering.
</div>

## Tidying your data

- The "tidy" principle is one observation per row and one variable per column
- But data is often not organized the way your analysis requires

## Tidying example: what you get

```{r}
table4a
```

## Tidying example: what you wanted

```{r}
table4a %>% gather(`1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

If you had many columns to gather, the following is equivalent:

```{r echo=TRUE,results='hide'}
table4a %>% gather(-country, key = "year", value = "cases")
```

<div class="notes">
> - `-country` selects all columns but `country`
> - `spread` is the opposite of `gather` so can be used when the data you have is currently in a "long" rather than a "wide" format
</div>

## Let's get statistical

```{r echo=TRUE}
flights %>% summarise(max(air_time, na.rm=TRUE))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
flights %>% 
  summarise(avg_time = mean(air_time, na.rm=TRUE),
            avg_speed = mean(distance/air_time, na.rm=TRUE))
```

<div class="notes">
> - remember you always have to deal with how to handle `NA` values
> - easy to add multiple summarized variable based on multiple variable
> - also can get summary statistics with `flights %>% summary`
</div>

## Get it together: weather

```{r}
weather %>%
  filter(origin == 'EWR') %>%
  head(5)
```

## Get it together: weather and flights

```{r}
flightsweather <- flights %>%
  left_join(weather, by = c("origin", "year", "month", "day", "hour")) %>%
  select(origin, dep_delay, wind_speed)
flightsweather %>%
  head(5)
```

<div class="notes">
> - We will save the joined dataset for future work
</div>

## Explore by visualizing

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.height=3}
flightsweather %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wind_speed, y=dep_delay)) +
    geom_point()
```

<div class="notes">
> - Introduce `ggplot2`
> - We can see roughly that with higher values of `visib` there were longer departure delays
</div>

## More than just pretty graphics

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.height=3}
flightsweather %>%
  filter(wind_speed < 250) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wind_speed, y=dep_delay)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = origin)) +
    geom_smooth()
```

<div class="notes">
> - Remove outliers
> - Color points by origin
> - Not an obvious relationship visible between these two variables
</div>

## Exploring groups of data as facets

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.height=3}
flightsweather %>%
  filter(wind_speed < 250) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=wind_speed, y=dep_delay)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = origin)) +
    geom_smooth() +
    facet_wrap(~ origin)
```
